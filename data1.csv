"I was looking for a desktop replacement for my home use. Not a hardcore gamer, just a guy who played games like COD, Project IGI, GTA, different NFS titles in college and some years after. So while replacing my years old desktop, thought of buying a so called ""gaming laptop"". Requirements were clear - laptop but not necessarily an ultra portable one (as mobile phone works well while on the move), expandable hardware (specially RAM), without any bias for AMD or Intel, have to be fairly latest and must be value for money. Though selected couple of others also from Lenevo and Dell; HP was most value for money of them. And 10th gen Core i5 with 8GB DDR4 (expandable to 16GB for sure), 512GB SSD, 1650Ti graphics card, 15.6 inch FHD display was enough for my need, with a budget of not crossing 60k after all discounts - this laptop is a good fit for my requirements.",positive
"Probably the best gaming laptop you can get for this budget. Gives 50-60fps for most games on high settings. Load times are incredibly fast, and it does not overheat. The battery life is on the lower side. Do not expect more than 3 hours of usage on a single charge while using a video calling app like zoom.",positive
"If you have the budget, GO FOR IT. No need to look on anything else. Firstly, it can be said, a laptop that runs game well does general works well. This model is tremendously fast and capable. I'm playing Days Gone PC at max settings (even with reshade applied to enhance quality furthermore), and no lags I could notice. A great option at this price. And you've HP's brand value and trust too.",positive
Very nice laptop.powerfull for gamming.sound and display quality is also good. running smooth.boot time takes around 5-8 sec. thanx to 512gb ssd.and the intel optane in superd we can use total of 40 gb as system memory,positive
"Best performance laptop under 70k. better performance, good for gaming, good performance in Editing. Battery lasts more than 3.5 hours with continuous useage with internet (without gaming and editing).display was good graphic designers can go for it.No heating issues at all.speaker is clear, crisp and awesome it's a different experience on speakers.hardware is quite good. Design as expected in pictures...",positive
Horrible experience with the laptop. First of all I received one product which was a used one then asked for a replacement and now the new one has keyboard issue and Spacebar issue. Don't buy HP laptops these are terrible. Not sure whether it is a fault of the vendor or HP but my experience is terrible with this.,negative
Best thing you can get at this price.its working fine. i am not able to boost the ram frequency to its max potential but youtube helped. only issue i had was with igpu feature that was not working properly mainly software issue. hope they fix it soon. the most amazing thing was its battery. i have used it above 6 hours with moderate usage from 80%. and the thermals are really great.,neutral
"The product is completely fine. Brightness control is not working both before and after updates. It can be an issue from amd or windows side. But facing this issue in a brand new product is not something a customer wants after sending 75k. Driver updates , microsoft basic adapter nothing works. Replaced the product.",negative
"Everything is perfect about that laptop.... But I'm not satisfied with Amazon's packaging, Laptop Box from asus was perfect but Amazon's outside additional box was not properly sealed and not jerk proof ..... So regarding e-commerce packaging , I must put 0/5.....  ",neutral
The laptop is quite well built. Has a good screen with much brightness for indoor uses. The keyboard also feels nice and the RGB has 4 stages of brightness. Will not get into the performance part yet because I have got this product just now.,positive
This is the 2021 variant. The images in the listing is for 2020 so don't worry you'll get the lastest R7 4800H RTX 3050 variant. Just received this an hour back and the I like what I see. Have seen a lot of reviews on YouTube to be sure that the performance is definitely worth the price. If there are any issues in this laptop then it's probably specific to my item and not the laptop in general. For 75k it's a steal. Go ahead without thinking twice!,positive
"It is a very good laptop for gaming ang productive work like online office or classes. It's battery life is very good when ur not playing any games but when playing playing games the battery will drain in an hour or so.overall I played Minecraft,fortnite and GTA V the fps are good and the laptop does not heat at all. It's SSD is also very fast so it makes the experience much better. I overall this is the best laptop I have ever seen in this price range.",positive
"It's a value for money deal. Great for gaming with different software adaptation modes. Super responsive screen 144Hz, RGB keyboard and the software is too good. For browsing and online classes, the battery may last upto more than 3Â½-5 hours on full charge. No heating issues. Upgradable SSD and HDD along with the RAM is a bonus.",positive
" I review it after a month , performance is great there is no lags in display the built  quality is also superb you never feel it's plastic body, it,s like a metal which is good. but I not get ms office 365 for life time it was installed in but for only trial, where I think they cheat in this category. So all the performance and quality is good you can buy without hesitation. If you not prefer their trail versions.",neutral
Awesome laptop for multitasking in this price range RGB keyboard is awesome and it takes around 4-5 secs to boot all because of SSD I believe and also there are no heating issues found battery lasts around 3hrs if we continuosly listen online classes it can be upgraded to Win 11  The only thing disappointed me is this variant is without MS office activated  camera quality is very good I expected a more battery life but as it is a gaming laptop the battery backup is ok and thanks to honeycomb design it really helps in heat dissipation as mentioned it meets military standards and when in charging turbo mode is activated which helps a lot only one small suggestion plz keep refresh rate @144Hz so that you will not face any screen blank issue for 2-3 secs when you connect or disconnect power source. I recommend this laptop to everyone who really wants to achieve something in their life and hidden features like MYAsus are add on for this laptop. I liked the RGB keyboard and the stickers provided in the box.,neutral
Guys After i received my laptop i checked screen bleeding test. Very high screen bleeding. Guys be alert. Check your laptop ASAP after receiving. I called Amazon and opted for replacement. They said they'll in 24-48 hr. So let's see what would they do. Be alert Heavy screen bleeding,negative
"ASUS gaming laptop..a worst choice.. we purchased one.. screen is blurred lights from corners.. if you put AC DC Adapter the screen will off for few seconds..when we contacted Amazon for replacement.. they simply say that contact Manufacturers.. Please don't buy expensive items such as laptops from Amazon..\""limited liability - simply says 7 days replacement or refund but nothing.. Amazon thieves.",negative
Good for work and gaming ðŸ‘  reviews after 2months of usage. Battery life is also good. Mostly used for work and sometimes gaming. Play almost all games with high fps. boot time is almost 5-8sec. Overall best and fast product.,positive
"Got this laptop within 24 hours. Amazon's one day delivery is quite good ,the packaging was proper . The laptop is very good I loved it ,I tried playing valorent on high graphic settings and got around 120-125 FPS which is really good. The battery backup is also good.",positive
"For the price, I think the performance is justified. I5 10300H is not that bad as people say it to be if you main purpose is playing games. But if you want to do workstation loads I would suggest Ryzen. Performance: The only game I played till now is Warzone. The game has become demanding I would say that much. If you are in some open area like farm fields you'll get around 65-72fps but if you are in lets say downtown you'll get around 57-65fps. Upgrade it 16gb for better performance. Now mine is 1650ti, if you go for 1650 expect some 6-10fps less. Thermals: This is the area I see people complain about most in TUF laptops. Again its not that bad as people complain it to be. I turn on my AC and the temps doesn't cross 88Â°C which is normal for a gaming laptop. Display: Smooth 144hz no complains there. Color accuracy, well - its decent. Like I mentioned before if you only want to game the colors are good. You can message me on instagram if you got anything else to ask. Its dannyy___18 but dont ask me to run workstation programs.",neutral
